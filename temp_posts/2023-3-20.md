# The Problem of Dog Shit

## The Disgusting Reality
It may not be the topic of polite conversation, but dog shit is an inevitable part of life with a pet dog. The mess, the smell, and the fly problem created by dog waste are hard (and gross!) to miss. 

## Hygienic Hazards
But beyond the obvious ick factor, dog mess can also be a source of serious hygiene issues. Dog poop can contain worms, parasites and carryable illnesses such as E. coli or cryptosporidium. 

## Solutions
The only way to keep the problem from spreading is to make sure dog owners clean up after their pets. Potential solutions could include:

* Making it socially unacceptable for owners not to clean up after their dog 
* Introducing laws to require or fine dog owners who do not clean up after their pet
* Encouraging owners to use biodegradable poo bags

The following code can be used to create a biodegradable poo bag using a 3D printer:

```
Print biodegradable-poo-bag.stl
filament diameter=1.75mm
layer height=0.2mm
print speed=50mm/s
nozzle temperature=210°C
bed temperature=60°C
```
